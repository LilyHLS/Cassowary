The southern cassowary (*Casuarius casuarius johnsonii)* is a territorial and solitary animal difficult to observe due to its endangered status and elusive behavior (Moore, 2007). Individuals have a territory estimated between 0.52 km² to 2.35 km² and only come into contact during the mating season or in area where food resources are important (Moore, 2007). This bird occur in the wet tropical rainforest of north-eastern Australia and in associated vegetation mosaics (Moore, 2007). It's a frugivorous bird that may also use other habitats for dispersal or as intermittent food resources (Westcott, 1999). Its ecological status is important as it's one of the few frugivorous capable of dispersing large rainforest fruit seeds over long distance (Westcott, 1999). In recent decades, populations have been affected by several factors such as natural catastrophic events, diseases, dog attacks, roads traffic and habitat implications, including degradation, fragmentation and loss (Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services 2001).

It is essential to estimate the factors that may impact the abundance of southern cassowary population in order to ensure its conservation. In 2026, Dwyer et *al*. used citizen science data to model the risk of traffic strike in Australia. Sum of road collisions and abundance data were recorded by Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services between 1992 and 2012 on a 1 km² grid-cells covering the study area.\
Using this data, compiled with the habitat variables and the distance of road location of each grid-cells (@tbl-descrva) by Dwyer et *al.* (2016), we aim to determine **which factors influence the southern cassowary abundance. And whether there are implications for strike mortality management.**

To answer these questions, we will use (model)....\
It is highly likely that there is spatial correlation between the different cells. The coordinates of the grid-cells centroids will enable us to test spatial autocorrelation with .....

*Hypothesis: We assume that southern cassowary is mainly distributed near its natural habitat or in areas where food is available. We expect that high proportions of rainforest and fruits are associated with greatest cassowary abundance. We also assume that traffic strike occur when the road is at a low distance from the centroid of the grid cell and that risk is higher when the road connects two favorable habitat.*

### Correlation between environmental variables

## Spatial data : cartography

```{r spatial configuration}
#| label: fig-1rstcarto_cells
#| fig-cap: "First view of grid-cells distribution"

plot(cassowary[,2:3])
```

The points are distributed continuously, even if some locations are missing (@fig-1rstcarto_cells).

By projecting the locations onto an OpenStreetMap, to look closer :

```{r}
#| label: fig-carto_cells
#| fig-cap: "Map of presence / absence of Cassowary seen on the grid-cells"

cassow_sf <- cassowary %>% 
  mutate(abs = ifelse(Sightings == 0, "abs", "pres"), 
         morta = ifelse(Strikes == 0, "pas_morta", "morta")) %>%
  st_as_sf(., coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = "EPSG:28355")  

cassow_sf %>% 
  mapview(zcol = "abs", layer.name = "Cassowary sightings", 
          map.types = c("OpenStreetMap.DE"))
```

The grid-cells are distributed evenly throughout the space, but follow the layout of the roads : therefore, there are no cells in the middle of the rainforests.\
The difference in the extent of rainforests between the OpenStreetMap base map (@fig-carto_cells) and that of the article is probably due to the time difference between the sources.

```{r}
#| label: fig-carto_pabs
#| fig-cap: "Map of Cassowary abundance on the grid-cells"

mapview(cassow_sf %>% filter(abs == "abs"), 
        zcol = "abs", col.regions = "white", layer.name = "Absence", 
        map.types = c("OpenStreetMap.DE")) + 
  mapview(cassow_sf %>% filter(abs == "pres"), 
          zcol = "Sightings", layer.name = "Abondance", 
          map.types = c("OpenStreetMap.DE"))
```

This map shows that cassowary sightings tend to be more common in the rainforest part (@fig-carto_pabs).

```{r}
#| label: fig-carto_collision
#| fig-cap: "Map of the number of collisions recorded"

mapview(cassow_sf %>% filter(morta == "pas_morta"), 
        zcol = "Strikes", col.regions = "white", 
        layer.name = "No traffic strikes recorded", 
        map.types = c("OpenStreetMap.DE")) + 
  mapview(cassow_sf %>% filter(morta == "morta"), 
          zcol = "Strikes", layer.name = "Number of traffic strikes recorded", 
          map.types = c("OpenStreetMap.DE"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mortality strike occur on the road near the rainforest and where cassowaries appear to be abundant.

# Statistical Analysis

## Spatial dependency

**1.) Investigation of spatial dependency with the semi variogram :**

**a.) Without any modification of the data :**

First, we have to investigate if there is spatial dependency in the variables and because this is a continuous process, we are going to visualize the semi variograms. For this first model, related to the first problematic **"Which factors influence the southern cassowary abundance?"** we do not take into account *Strikes* and the variables linked to the road (*Total_Road, Dresid and Dfruit*).

```{r}
geo_sight=as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]),data.frame(cassowary$Sightings)))
geo_residb=as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]),data.frame(cassowary$Residential.01)))
geo_fruitb=as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]),data.frame(cassowary$Fruit.01)))
geo_rainp=as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]),data.frame(cassowary$Rainforest.P)))
geo_residp=as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]),data.frame(cassowary$Residential.P)))
geo_fruitp=as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]),data.frame(cassowary$Fruit.P)))
geo_otherp=as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]),data.frame(cassowary$Other.P)))
```

In order to plot the semi variance plot (semivariogram) for the variables, especially the responde variable, we need to look at the distribution of distance between points.

```{r}
hist(dist(cassowary[,2:3]))
```

We can see that 95% of the distance are under 25 000, 30 000 (m ?).

```{r semivar}
semivar_sight <- variog(geo_sight, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000, messages = FALSE)
semivar_rain <- variog(geo_rainp, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000, messages = FALSE)
semivar_residb <- variog(geo_residb, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000, messages = FALSE)
semivar_fruitb <- variog(geo_fruitb, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000, messages = FALSE)
semivar_residp <- variog(geo_residp, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000, messages = FALSE)
semivar_fruitp <- variog(geo_fruitp, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000, messages = FALSE)
semivar_otherp <- variog(geo_otherp, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000, messages = FALSE)

plot(semivar_sight, main = "Empirical semi variogram for sightings of cassowary")
plot(semivar_rain, main = "Empirical semi variogram for proportion of rainforest")
plot(semivar_residb, main = "Empirical semi variogram for presence/absence of residential area")
plot(semivar_fruitb, main = "Empirical semi variogram for presence/absence of fruit crop")
plot(semivar_residp, main = "Empirical semi variogram for proportion of residential area")
plot(semivar_fruitp, main = "Empirical semi variogram for proportion of fruit crop")
plot(semivar_otherp, main = "Empirical semi variogram for proportion of other")
```

As we can see on all the plots, except maybe for the semi variogram for presence/absence of residential area, **the values between points seem to become less similar when distance increases until it reaches 15 000 or 20 000 (km?)** because from this point, the variance seems to decrease and so points start becoming more similar again. On the semi variogram for proportion of fruit crop, we can even see 2 maxima.

As we can see on all the plots, except maybe for the semi variogram for presence/absence of residential area, the values between points seem to become less similar when distance increases until it reaches 15 000 or 20 000 (m?) because from this point, the variance seems to decrease and so points start becoming more similar again. On the semi variogram for proportion of fruit crop, we can even see 2 maxima.

These types of graphs are usually typical of a **periodic phenomenon**, also known as **patches or clusters**, however, here we did not apply any transformation on the data. In fact, *Sighthings* are counting data (Poisson law), *Residential.P* and *Fruit.P* present a lot of zeros (zero-inflated method), *Residential.01* and *Fruit.01* are presence/absence data (Binomial law).

This is an important thing to consider because behind the variogram, there are 2 fundamental assumptions valid for any location, also known as the second-order stationarity : the stationarity of the expected value and the stationarity of the covariance (covariance between two points depends only on the spatial shift of vector `h`, and not on the absolute positions). These assumptions presuppose a certain spatial homogeneity of the phenomenon under study, which is not the case by default for our variables of interest (for instance, for counting data, the variance increases linearly with the mean).

**b.) With modification of the data** : I don't think we'll keep it..

Let's first try with the *Sightings* data. Maybe, remove the variables *Residential.01* and *Fruit.01* because of redundant information with the variables *Residential.P* and *Fruit.P* ? Transform the variables *Residential.01* and *Fruit.01* into qualitative ones ?

```{r}
glm_pois <- glm(Sightings ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Fruit.P + Other.P + 
                  Residential.01 + Fruit.01, 
                data = cassowary, family = poisson(link = "log"))
```

Overdispersion check (scale parameter calculation) :

```{r}
E1 <- resid(glm_pois, type = "pearson") # (Y - mu) / sqrt(mu)
N  <- nrow(cassowary)
p  <- length(coef(glm_pois))
sum(E1^2) / (N - p)
```

Here, the Pearson residuals are way above 1, so there is overdispersion which can be due to outliers, missing interactions and zero inflation.

```{r}
glm_NB <- glm.nb(Sightings ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Fruit.P + Other.P + 
                   Residential.01 + Fruit.01, 
                 data = cassowary)

drop1(glm_NB, test = "Chi")
```

```{r}
glm_NB <- glm.nb(Sightings ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Other.P + 
                   Residential.01 + Fruit.01, 
                 data = cassowary)

drop1(glm_NB, test = "Chi")
```

```{r}
glm_NB <- glm.nb(Sightings ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Other.P + Fruit.01, 
                 data = cassowary)

drop1(glm_NB, test = "Chi")
```

```{r}
glm_NB <- glm.nb(Sightings ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Other.P,
                 data = cassowary)

drop1(glm_NB, test = "Chi")
```

Here, there is the final model with only significant effects. Again, we check for overdispersion :

```{r}
E1 <- resid(glm_NB, type = "pearson") # (Y - mu) / sqrt(mu)
N  <- nrow(cassowary)
p  <- length(coef(glm_NB))
sum(E1^2) / (N - p)
```

No more overdispersion.

```{r}
geo_resid <- as.geodata(SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]), data.frame(E1)))
semivar_resid <- variog(geo_resid, option = "bin", max.dist = 30000)
plot(semivar_resid, main = "Semi-variogramme des résidus NB")
```

We still have an abnormal semi variogram ???

**2.) Geostatistical model** :

We are now interested in the relationship that could occur between *Sightings* and the explanatory variables, taking into account the spatial effect.

**a.) Getting the residuals of the NB model** :

Usually, at first, we decide to fit a simple linear regression model to the data. However, here we already know this is not the best model to consider at first, especially because of the counting data we have for our response variable.

```{r}
glm_NB<-glm.nb(Sightings ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Other.P, data=cassowary)
summary(glm_NB)
```

Test for the autocorrelation in the residuals :

```{r}
#or Dharma procedure based on a Moran test
testSpatialAutocorrelation(simulateResiduals(glm_NB),x=cassowary$latitude,y=cassowary$longitude)
testSpatialAutocorrelation(simulationOutput, x, y)
```

For each point, we have a local Moran index. The distance based autocorrelation of the residuals is highly significative (p-value \< 2.2e-16). In the case of a stationary process, the residuals are spatially random, however here the intensities and the colours of the points vary a lot which is a sign of a global non-stationarity of the relationship between *Sightings* and the explanatory variables.

**b.) GWR because of the non-stationarity** :

We define the SpatialPointsDataFrame with both variables and coordinates and we optimize the bandwidth for the kernel function. I tried to use a GGWR rather than a GWR because, like we saw, the Negative binomial model seem to be the most appropriate one. However, the ***bw.ggwr*** and ***gwr.generalised*** functions didn't work as expected (a lot of problems I didn't know how to solve). So, here I simply used the log(x+1) transformation on the response variable and the ***gwr*** function for general linear models.

```{r}
geocass=SpatialPointsDataFrame(data.frame(cassowary[,2:3]), data.frame(cassowary[,c("Rainforest.P","Residential.P","Other.P","Fruit.P", "Sightings")]))
gwr.bw=gwr.sel(log(Sightings+1) ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Other.P + Fruit.P,data=geocass,adapt=FALSE)
lmgwrD=gwr(log(Sightings+1) ~ Rainforest.P + Residential.P + Other.P + Fruit.P,data=geocass,bandwidth = gwr.bw, se.fit=T,hatmatrix=T)
summary(lmgwrD)
```

The main interesting output is the SDF : the variables (intercept) and "Rainforest.P", "Residential.P", "Other.P"and "Fruit.P" give the regression coefficients. Intercept.se and Rainforest.P\_\_se, Residential.P\_\_se, Other.P\_\_se and Fruit.P\_\_se give the coefficient standard errors.

```{r}
names(lmgwrD$SDF)
```

Since it is a spatial object we can map the coefficient and their significativity. Significativity of coefficient is not automatically computed by R, but, we can use the coefficient and their standard error to get a t-statistic. Under the null hypothesis, the t ratio follows a t distribution, and hence one can calculate the probability. To do this, first get the degrees of freedom from the gwr results object. For instance, we can test the significativity

```{r}
dfree=lmgwrD$results$edf

vars <-c("Rainforest.P", "Residential.P", "Other.P", "Fruit.P")

gwr_signif_all <- lapply(vars, function(v) {
  
  # Coefficient et erreur standard pour la variable v
  beta <- lmgwrD$SDF[[v]]
  se <- lmgwrD$SDF[[paste0(v, "_se")]]
  
  # Calculs statistiques
  t_val <- beta / se
  p_val <- 2 * (1 - pt(abs(t_val), df = dfree))
  
  # Classes
  classe_beta <- ifelse(beta < 0, "negative",
                        ifelse(beta > 0, "positive", "zero"))
  
  classe_p <- ifelse(p_val < 0.05, "p<0.05", "p>0.05")
  
  # Data frame local

    variable = v,
    x = coordinates(geocass)[,1],

    t = t_val,
    p = p_val,
    classe_beta = classe_beta,
    classe_p = classe_p
  )
}) %>% bind_rows()
