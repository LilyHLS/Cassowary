	abstract = {Large-bodied frugivores are essential to the ecological function of rainforest communities. The southern cassowary (Casaurius casuarius johnsonii) is the only large frugivore in the tropical rainforests of Australia. Here, we assessed whether cassowaries remain important to native plant seed dispersal in areas where the rainforest is highly fragmented, and exotic fruits are abundant. To do this, we developed a tri-axial acceleration logger integrated with a motion sensor and {VHF} radio transmitter. The telemetry device was small enough to be hidden inside a native fruit. The cassowaries ingested it, transported it and defecated it up to 24 h later with the seeds from the fruits they had ingested during the tracking period. The telemetry device was then located by {VHF} radio and collected with the scat. The distance travelled, activity profile, consumed fruit diversity, and scat energy content were assessed for cassowaries inhabiting regions with different degrees of urbanization. We found that cassowaries inhabiting more urbanized areas consumed the greatest proportion of fruits from exotic plants ( 30\%) but still incorporated a significant proportion of fruits from native plants in their diet. These individuals existed in higher states of activity and rested less than individuals inhabiting more intact swathes of rainforest, actively moving between urban gardens and the rainforest. The study shows cassowaries have a flexible foraging strategy that has enabled them to persist in rainforest-fragmented landscapes. They remain a significant disperser of seeds from native plants between rainforest patches, and as such, cassowaries remain essential in maintaining native plant diversity within these fragmented patches.},

	abstract = {The use of surveys of sign (e.g. dung, tracks and sightings) to estimate abundance is a method in common usage with a variety of vertebrates, especially forest species and those with cryptic habits. Particularly for endangered species, such as the southern cassowary, Casuarius casuarius , the resulting abundance estimates, at both regional and local scales, can be fundamental to management and conservation decisions. Current estimates of regional cassowary abundance in North Queensland are based on the results of surveys that documented indicators of cassowary activity across the Wet Tropics Region. When applied to population abundance estimation this approach assumes (i) that cassowary sign is as likely to be encountered on trails as it is in the forest generally, and (ii) that there is a relationship between the amount of cassowary sign encountered and the number of birds using a trail. These assumptions were tested in a project conducted in Wooroonooran National Park, north Queensland. In failing to support either assumption, the fieldwork identified the need for the improvement of large-scale survey techniques for cassowaries, and for caution in the application of this method and the interpretation of its results more generally. In the case of cassowaries, improvements to the current method could be achieved by incorporating multiple surveys at each site, assessment of local use of trails by cassowaries and of fruit abundance at the time of surveying.},

	abstract = {Assessing the causal factors underpinning the distribution and abundance of wildlife road-induced mortality can be challenging. This is particularly ubiquitous for rare or elusive species, because traffic strikes occur infrequently for these populations and information about localized abundance, distribution and movements are generally lacking. Here, we assessed whether citizen-collected sightings data may serve as a low cost and efficient means of gathering long-term animal roadside presence and road-crossing information, which could then be used to assess the causative factors and direct mitigation actions aimed at reducing wildlife traffic strike frequency. We explored this principle using two decades of traffic strike records and citizen-collected sightings of the southern cassowary Casuarius casuarius johnsonii. Roads have bisected the cassowaries’ rain forest habitat and despite considerable investment into mitigation strategies for this species, road-induced mortality is considered one of the primary threatening processes affecting the population. Using a Bayesian approach and controlling for spatial autocorrelation with conditional autoregressive models, we demonstrate that traffic strikes are primarily a density-dependent process in the southern cassowary. That is, traffic strike clusters occurred along stretches of road where cassowaries were most frequently sighted. There were, however, road stretches where traffic strike frequency was greater than predicted by the number of roadside sightings, illustrating when and where density-independent processes increased the mortality potential for a road-crossing cassowary. Synthesis and applications. This is the first time that citizen-collected sightings data have been used to systematically inform upon the abundance and distribution of wildlife traffic strike. The technique not only predicts where incidents are likely to occur but also helps us to understand the factors responsible for strike clustering. While not a replacement for systematic surveys, we highlight citizen-collected sightings data as a low-cost option when assessing contributing factors to vehicle-induced mortality. Accounting for density-dependent and density-independent processes will ensure the most effective allocation of resources when implementing wildlife traffic strike mitigation.},

	abstract = {Little is known of the ecology and population dynamics of the world’s largest avian frugivore. This study investigated the population of endangered southern cassowary at Mission Beach, northeast Australia, and examined the problems associated with determining population size and density of this keystone species. Using the results of an intensive field survey aimed at estimating absolute numbers of individual cassowaries, the appropriate sampling methodology for rare and elusive species was explored. Approximately 102 km2 of rainforest was surveyed using 346 km of search transects. Of a total of 110 cassowaries, there were 49 adults (28 male, 19 female, 2 unknown), 28 subadults, 31 chicks, and 2 independent birds of unknown status. This is approximately 35\% of the adult population previously estimated for the Mission Beach area. Overall adult cassowary density was 0.48 adults/km2; the density of independent birds, i.e. adults and subadults, was 0.78 birds/km2. Mean indicative home range ({IHR}) for adult females and males was 2.13 and 2.06 km2, respectively. Mean {IHR} of subadults was smaller at 0.95 km2. It was concluded that the previous practice of surveying small areas at Mission Beach ({\textless}4 km2) has led to consistent overestimation of cassowary population density, up to six times its real number. It is shown that a sample plot between 5 and 15 km2 is necessary to approximate true cassowary density. These findings have significant application to the conservation of cassowaries in New Guinea and in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of Australia.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Ecological count data (e.g. number of individuals or species) are often log-transformed to satisfy parametric test assumptions. 2. Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

	abstract = {Roads act as significant disruptors to wildlife movement through landscapes, even in relatively undisturbed areas. Large terrestrial vertebrates often choose to cross roads, which brings risk of injury or mortality from vehicle collision. In the Wet Tropics bioregion in Queensland, Australia, the range of the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) spans a diversity of habitats and intensity of road network development. There has been a large increase in the human population within cassowary habitat in recent decades and at local scales there remains concern over increasing mortality caused by vehicle collision.To inform management decisions on where is the best to direct collision mitigation resources based on identifying environmental factors that correlate with higher collision risk.We collated 28 years of data on cassowary–vehicle collisions from across the bioregion and sought to identify ecological, physical and anthropogenic correlates of collision at both landscape- and location-specific scales.We identified a major hotspot of reported cassowary–vehicle collisions in a large area of coastal lowland between Innisfail and Mission Beach. At a landscape scale, vehicle collisions increased significantly when the proportion of cassowary core habitat in the landscape was \&gt;50\% and as the density of major roads increased. To a lesser extent, collisions increased when minor road density exceeded 400 m/km2. At a location-specific scale, vehicle collisions are more likely to occur on straight sections of major roads that have high canopy cover on both sides of the road and were less likely to occur on roads passing through land use types with low canopy cover.Our findings highlight the significant challenges faced in effectively addressing the cassowary–vehicle collision problem in the Wet Tropics bioregion. Where cassowary habitat and roads intersect, cassowary mortality will occur.Construction of new roads within rainforest should be avoided where possible and over- or under-passes should be constructed on new and existing major roads that intersect cassowary habitat and where location-specific correlates of cassowary collision exist. In addition, further collision mitigation measures such as traffic slowing should be targeted with these results in mind.},
